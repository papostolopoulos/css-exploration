      <h1>Specificity</h1><br>
      <p>Specificity is useful
      to understand because it helps us set priorities when two different
      elements share conflicting properties.</p><br>

      <h2>CSS changes at a tag level</h2><br>
      <p>In this paragraph and all paragraphs
      that follow, we have changed the font
      size  to 20 pixels, the left padding to 10 pixels and the text color
        to green. <br>
        This change replaces the default browser values using the following code:</p><br>
        <p>
          <code>
            p {<br>
            		color: green;<br>
                left-padding: 10px; <br>
            		font-size: 20px;<br>
            }<br>
        </code>
      </p><br>

      <h2>CSS changes at a Class level</h2><br>
      <p class="class-example1">While some paragraphs below have been given the
        same css property values as the opening paragraph at the tag level,<br>
        they are displayed differently
        on the page because they have also been given classes. <br>
        These paragraphs have been given a class named
        "class-example1": </p>
        <p>
          <code>&#60;p class="class-example1"&#62;</code><br.
        </p>
        <p class="class-example1"> The values of
        these classes have priority over all values at the tag level.
        The text color is now larger and blue (30 pixels).
        Likewise, any other paragraphs that are also defined with the same class
        are rendered in the same way.</p><br>
      <p>This paragraph has reverted
         back to the original <code>&#60;p&#62;</code> tag formatting.
        Since it does not have a class assigned to it, the content renders based
        on the values given to it at the <code>&#60;p&#62;</code> tag level.</p><br>
      <p>Now, watch how the cascade works. Take a look at the code below. Notice how
        there are conflicting property values given to the class named "class-example2".</p><br>

          <code>
          p { <br>
          .class-example2 {<br>
          	color: blue;<br>
          }<br>
<br>

          .class-example2 {<br>
          	color: yellow;<br>
          }<br>
<br>

          .class-example2 {<br>
          	color: red;<br>
          }<br>
      </code><br>
      <p class="class-example2">
      In this example, we first define the class as having a font color blue. <br>
      We then alter the cascade by setting the class's color to yellow.<br>
      Finally, we change the color to red. <br>
      Because the font color red was the last
        value defined in the cascade, it took precedence over green and yellow. <br>
        This is an example of how the properties of an element can be altered
        downward in the cascade by resetting property values.</p><br>

      <h2>CSS changes at an ID level</h2><br>
      <p class="class-example2" id="id-example1">We have now used another selector,
        the id, to change this paragraph to purple and the font size to 20 pixels. <br>
        Even though this paragraph also has a class that defines the font color as red,
        it is purple because of the unique ID. </p><br>
      <code>
          #id-example1 {<br>
          	color: purple;<br>
          	font-size: 20px;<br>
          }<br>
      </code><br>

      <h2>Summary</h2><br>
      <p class="class-example3">We have now used another class and no id for this
        and the following paragraphs.</p>
      <code>
        p { <br>
        .class-example3 {<br>
          font-size: 20px;<br>
          color: black;<br>
        }<br>
      </code>
      <br><br>
      <p class="class-example3">In the examples shown above, we obtain
        specificity in our style sheets by different methods. <br>
        Once a style is defined for an element, it will persist <br>
        unless defined otherwise in a CSS selector that occurs later on the stylesheet.</p><br>
        <p class="class-example3">
          Second, we have a heirachy of precedence. <br>
          When using just the element as
          the selector in our CSS, we have assigned the lowest amount of weight for that style. <br>
          Classes have more weight than element tags when used as selectors, and therefore,
          the values defined by their properties will take precedence over that of those
          defined for the element tags. </p><br>


      <p class="class-example3">Lastly, ID's take precedence over classes,
        but also must be unique to a single element tag.</p><br>

  <!-- <section id="#interactiveSectionId">
    <p>The CSS that is added in an html document can be added in different categories of tags.</p>
    <p>When a css rule is applied in a particular tag, then that means that all the tags in the document
      are affected by the CSS rule.</p>
      <p>Therefore, if you would add a particular width property like: <code>div {width: 150px;}</code>,<br>
        that would mean that all the div tags in the document would have a width of 150 pixels.</p><br>
    <p>As a developer, you have the option of being more specific on which tags should get the settings you have defined.</p>
    <p>You can be more specific on which selectors get the properties you are working on by using:</p>
    <ul class="mainSectionUl">
      <li><u>A class property</u> in the event that you want some of the same tags to be styled in a particular way
        but you do not want all the tags with the same styling.</li>
      <li><u>An id property</u> in case you want only one specific tag to be styled in a particular way
        but you do not want other tags to have the same styling.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>There are several occasions where tags have more than one classes and more than one ids applied to them.</p>
    <p>That is because we might be using different classes to accomplish different, overlapping or supplementing styling formats.</p>
    <p>In order to be able to define the styling of tags in a priority base,
    CSS uses a <u>specificity</u> weight.</p>
    <p>In short, specificity means that ids have more weight than classes, and classes have more weight than tags.</p><br>
    <p>For example, let's assume you have an <code>h2</code> tag that has the following structure:</p>
    <code>&#60;h2 class="redBoldClass" id="greenUnderlineId"&#62;</code>
    <p>And also let's assume that you have the following CSS code (dot is for classes, # is for ids)</p>
    <code>
      h2 {<br>
        color: yellow;<br>
        font-size: 30px;<br>
      } <br>
      <br>
      .redBoldClass { <br>
        color: red;<br>
        font-size: 25px; <br>
        font-weight: bold; <br>
      } <br>
      <br>
      #greenUnderlineId { <br>
        color: green; <br>
        font-size: 35px; <br>
        text-decoration: underline<br>
      } <br>
    </code>
    <p>The particular CSS tag would end up having a <code>green</code> color,
     a font size of <code>35px</code> and a text decoration of <code>underline</code>.</p>
    <p>That is because the ids have a greater weight in specificity.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, all the other <code>h2</code> tags that have the same class will inherit
    the properties from the <code>.redBoldClass</code>,
    while the <code>h2</code> tags that do not have and class or id attached to them,
    will inherit the properties from the CSS applied in the h2 tag.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>How was CSS used</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Nothing was added in this chapter.</li>
      <li>Where needed, the different tags were given class and id names.</li>
    </ul>
