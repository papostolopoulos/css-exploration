            <p>
              Hello and welcome to the CSS Tutorial. This tutorial works as a point
              of reference for me but also can be used by whomever thinks it might
              be useful to his/her knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is a basic tutorial about CSS and how we can use different css
              settings to accomplish functionality and a create visibly pleasing
              and functional content when we are building a web page. You should
              already have some familiarity with the structure of an html document
              and how the html tags are nested within each other.
            </p>
            <p>
              As we progress through this tutorial, you will be seeing different
              examples of css and different techniques. This is by no means an
              extensive work portraying how CSS works. On the contrary, there are
              other very good online resources that you can use for that purpose.
              Yet, this resource is being built step by step, as my own knowledge
              and understanding grows and new techniques are being incorporated on
              other projects I am working on.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hence, this work will probaby have pieces of information missing and
              it might be flawed BUT the language I will try to use will be simple
              without too many complicated terms and with a lot of practice areas.
              So let's get started!
            </p>



            <h2>Structure of tutorial</h2>
            <p>
              This tutorial is broken in different chapters based on the topic you would
              like to study. Each chapter is constituted by the following core components:
            </p>
            <h5>Chapter topic</h5>
            <p>
              This is where the particular topic is being discussed along with some
              generic information.
            </p>
            <h5>Properties to learn</h5>
            <p>
              There are different properties in CSS that do different things for
              particular topics. I will try to cover as many different properties
              as possible. This is where the properties are being registered.
            </p>
            <h5>Example</h5>
            <p>
              This is where I will be displaying an example of how to use the different
              properties being taught. You will be able to review the html and css
              code and also play with it.
            </p>
            <h5>Practice</h5>
            <p>
              This is where you will be given a task to complete. There is an option
              where you can toggle between your code and the solution so it is okay
              if you get stuck since you will be able to get some help if you need to.
            </p>




            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <p>
              This tutorial has example areas where snippets of code along with the
              outcome are being displayed. The example areas allow you to change
              the content if you would like to experiment. Also, if you wish to revisit
              the original example after your edits, just click on the "reset" button.
            </p>
          </article>



          <div class="divExampleContainer">
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p>
              In this area, there will be a description of what the example is displaying.
              Feel free to experiment with the example's different options and
              click on "reset" if you want to revert back to the original version.
            </p>
            <example-area class="exampleArea">
              <span>
                h1{
                  color: red;
                }

                p{
                  font-family: Tahoma, Arial;
                  color: gray;
                }
              </span>
              <h1>Hello there I am the example area!</h1>
              <p>
                If you want, you can run tests in this area. You can update the
                HTML code on the top left slot where the HTML code exists and you
                can update the CSS in the bottom left area.
              </p>
              <p>
                Do you think you can change the property of the <code>h1</code> tag
                to read: <i>Hello there, this is my first example</i>
              </p>
              <p>
                Also, do you think you can change the color of the h1 tag from <code>red</code>
                to <code>rgb(0, 113, 184)</code>
              </p>
              <p>
                If you wish to, you can click on the "reset" button to view
                the original code.

            <h2>Practices</h2>
            <p>
              The practice area will have some coding problem that you can try to resolve.
              The things that are asked relate to the learnings of the particular
              chapter but there may be some components from previous chapters as well. You
              can have fun working on the challenge. And also, if you do not close the
              browser window, your work will not be lost, even if you navigate to
              other chapters of this tutorial.
            </p>
            <p>
              There will be a description of the problem you can try to solve.
              You can always look at the solution of the problem if you need help.
              You can revert back to the original version of the problem and continue
              your work.

            <h4>Practice</h4>
            <p>
              Let's work on our basic syntax. Try to do the following:
            </p>
            <h5>HTML</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Create an <code>h1</code> tag with text that reads: My first CSS code
              </li>
              <li>
                Create a <code>p</code> tag with text that reads: <i>This is my first
                code in the CSS tutorial. I think it is great!</i>
              </li>
              <li>
                Wrap the word "great" inside a <code>b</code> tag.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h5>CSS</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Give to the <code>h1</code> tag the property of <code>font-family</code>
                with a value of "Tahoma".
              </li>
              <li>
                Give the h1 tag the property of <code>font-style</code> with the
                value "italic".
              </li>
              <li>
                Give to the <code>h1</code> tag the property of <code>color</code>
                with the value of "blue".
              </li>
              <li>
                Give the <code>p</code> tag the property of <code>font-size</code>
                with the value of "16px"
              </li>
              <li>
                Give to the <code>b</code> tag the property of <code>font-variant</code>
                with the value of "small-caps"
              </li>
            </ul>


            <practice-area class="exampleArea">
              <span>
                h1{

                p {

            <h1>CSS Syntax</h1>
            <h5>Chapter Topic</h5>
            <p>
              I am covering the way that the basic CSS syntax is structured.
            </p>
            <h5>Properties to Learn</h5>
            <p>
              <p>
                No specific properties being taught.
                This chapter talks about the syntax of the CSS in general.
              </p>
            </p>
            <h5>Example</h5>
            <p>
              I am displaying how the CSS syntax is affecting the view of a page.
              I am also including some comments that display how some of the CSS is
              disabled.
            </p>
            <h5>Practice</h5>
            <p>
              You will need to write some things that confirm you understand how the
              CSS syntax works and what the elements are. Also you will need to describe
              the different distinction marks that separate the different CSS elements
              as well as how the comments are formed.
            </p>




            <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
            <p>
              CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is a style language sheet that
              is being used to modify the way an HTML page is being presented. Let's take
              a random person as an example. This person might wear a coat, a skirt,
              and a hat one day, and jeans, a t-shirt and glasses the other day. The
              person is always the same but the way she looks is different based on
              the clothes she is wearing.
              Likewise, CSS can give a different look, feel and level of interactivity
              to the different components of the HTML page, based on the different
              properties we are modifying to the elements (tags) of the HTML page.
            </p>



            <h2>Syntax structure</h2>
            <p>
              CSS has a syntax that has some similarities to the way JSON files or
              JavaScript object literals are structured.
              The main components of CSS are the following:
            </p>
            <h3>Selector</h3>
            <p>
              The selector is the one that points to the HTML element (or elements)
              that you want to style. If this would be stated in plain English,
              it would read like: <i>I want you to select the <code>h1</code>
              tags.</i>
            </p>
            <h3>Declarations</h3>
            <p>
              These are the different properties that state the
              type of styling you want a particular element to have and what the
              value is. If this would be stated in plain English, it would read
              something like: <em>I want to select the <code>h1</code>
              tags.</em> (selector) <em>and I want their <code>color</code> to
              be <code>green</code></em>. --&gt; <code>h1{ color: green; }</code>. <br>
              Notice how the declaration is siting between two curly braces. All
              the declarations of a selector are included between two curly braces
              and they are separated by semi-colons (;).
            </p>
            <h3>Property</h3>
            <p>
              The property is the entity that states what needs to
              change (eg: color, positioning, background, display). It is the first
              part of the declaration, before the colon symbol (:) --&gt;
              <code>h1{ color: &lt;-- The property is the one to the left; }</code>
            </p>
            <h3>Value</h3>
            <p>
              The value is the entity that states how the property changes /
              what the value of the property is. --&gt;
              <code>h1 { The value is the one to the right --&gt; green; }</code>
            </p>


            <h2>Comments</h2>
            <p>
              Comments is CSS are created by using a forward slash and a star to open them,
              and a star followed by a forward slash to close them. Comments can be a convenient
              way to keep notes about edits that are being done in CSS or temporarily

                In this section, you can see how the CSS of the paragraphs is
                set so that it has a <code>blue</code> color.

                The <code>font-family</code>
                and the <code>font-size</code> are in the CSS script but the formatting
                is not visible because they are disabled by the comment.

              <ul>

            <h1>Reset</h1>
            <h5>Chapter Topic</h5>
            <h5>Properties to Learn</h5>
            <h5>Example</h5>
            <h5>Practice</h5>
            <p>
              All the different popular browsers come in the market with some predefined
              format for several of the primary HTML elements. That happens because
              in the past, when CSS was not that widely used, the web pages were more
              static and there was uniformity in some key components of the pages.
              Hence, the browsers come with some format for all the <code>h</code>
              tags, there is usually some predefined <code>padding</code> and <code>margin</code>
              and finaly, the <code>font-size</code> and <code>font-family</code> is
              predefined.
            </p>
            <p>
              Things get more complicated because different browsers are handling
              the above and several other properties in a different way. Therefore,
              when the web developer creates a new CSS environment, unexpected results
              might render in specific browsers, if compared to other ones. Hence
              the web developer cannot accomplish uniformity in the online experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              In order to resolve this challenge, the developers go through a process
              of <i>normalizing</i> some or all of the styles that are being affected.
              There are several different flavors of CSS reset that you can chose from.
              Some of them are very detailed and extensive while others are barebones
              simple. Depending on your level of knowledge and comfort, you can go
              with any way. My suggestion is to start with the absolute basics first
              and then start thinking if you want to reset more things. In that way,
              you will avoid any unexpected browser behavior and you will not have to
              rebuild the CSS from the ground up and for elements that you were not
              planning to change anyway. An example could be the reset of the <code>li</code>
              elements in ordered and unordered lists. If you are fine with the way
              the <code>li</code> elements are rendering, then you should not go ahead
              and reset them because then nothing will render with a bullet or a
              numbered order, unless you define them again in your own CSS.
            </p>
            <p>
              A very barebones CSS reset could be the following:
            </p>
            <code>
              * {
                    margin: 0;
                    padding: 0;
                }
            </code>
            <p>
              This format would allow you to get rid of all the padding and the margin
              of all elements but all the other characteristins that are preset in
              the browser (font family and size, vertical align, borders etc) would
              stay the same. If you want to use some more complicated reset option,
              you can do an online search and find several useful pages that provide
              different options on how to reset the CSS in the browser. Finally, there
              is even a library called <b>normalize.css</b> that does the job for you
              if you decide to install it in your application.
