      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hello and welcome to the CSS Tutorial page.</p>
      <p>This is a basic tutorial about CSS and how we can use different css settings
        to accomplish functionality and create visibly pleasing content.</p>
      <p>Before we begin with our CSS tutorial, we added some basic html elements to the page.
        These elements are some of the most common found in html pages.</p>
        <p>We are assuming that you already have some familiarity with html tags
          and how they are nested within each other.</p>
      <p>In this page, we have added some basic headers, nav tags, links, paragraphs
        and general structural tags.</p>
      <p>At this point, this page is completely stripped of CSS and the only thing that
        renders is the lines of text that are being typed within the html document.</p>
      <p>As we progress through this tutorial, we will be adding new CSS rules and
        we will be moving things around in order to make our page more pleasing to view
        and more functional.</p>

        <h2>A brief history of HTML/CSS</h2>
        <p>In the early days of the world wide web (WWW), documents or other
          information were often sent as simple plain text across the wires that
          formed the internet. <br>
          Because the original intent was to allow scientists to share information
          at the particle accelerator <a href="http://home.cern/">CERN</a>,
          <a href="http://webfoundation.org/about/vision/history-of-the-web/">Sir Tim Berners-Lee</a>,
          the inventor of the WWW, developed the Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML). <br>
          HTML included the means to allow some basic formatting of the documents
          being shared. </p>

          <p>Once styling became more complex and demanding, there was a need for
            a way that would allow the separation of the code that related to the
            styling of the page from the rest of the document. </p>
          <p>CSS was introduced in order to satisfy this need. CSS files are used
            to control the attributes of a webpage, while the overall style of an html page
            is being managed through separate files.</p>
          <p>By including some type of order and precedence we can keep CSS code DRY
            (don't repeat yourself). This increases readability for the developer
            while reducing the memory
            requirements on both the client and the server side,
            as well as during the transmission process.</p>


        <h2>How was CSS used on this page?</h2>
      <p>Even though there is no CSS applied to the page, you can see that some
        formatting is already applied to it.</p>
      <p>This formatting comes from the browser's preset settings and it might be different
        from how other browsers format the page.</p>
        <p>That is why you see things like:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The <code>&#60;h1&#62; and &#60;h2&#62;</code> tags of the page in a larger font size.</li>
          <li>The fonts of the page being in a specific preset font format.</li>
          <li>Some indentation between the text and the window's frame.</li>
          <li>Spacing between the different paragraphs and the headers of the page.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>As you progress through the pages of this tutorial, you will be able to see the css code
          that we added by viewing the things entered in the <code>&#60;code&#62;</code>
          tag.</p>
          <p>For example, you will see code displayed like this:</p>
          <code>
            h1 {<br>
          	font-size: 3.2rem;<br>
          	line-height: 5.2rem;<br>
          	font-family: Arial;<br>
          	font-weight: 600;<br>
          }<br>
        </code>
